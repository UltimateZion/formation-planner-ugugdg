# Team Formation Planner

A flexible mobile app to plan and manage football team formations for Gaelic football (GAA) and soccer. Unlike fixed 11‑a‑side apps, this tool supports any team size, lets you mark player availability, and manage substitutes with a dedicated bench area.

> **Designed by Paul Halton**

## Key Features

* **Any team size** (1–30 players)
* **GAA pitch layout** with goals at top & bottom and proper field markings
* **Drag & drop players** anywhere on the pitch
* **Player management**: Add, edit, mark available/unavailable
